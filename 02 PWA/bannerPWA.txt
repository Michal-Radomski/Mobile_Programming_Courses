Here are some key ways to show a PWA install banner:

1. Meet the installability criteria:
- Have a valid web app manifest file with required fields like name, icons, start_url etc.
- Be served over HTTPS
- Register a service worker with a fetch event handler
- Meet engagement heuristics (e.g. user visits site twice in two weeks)[1]

2. Let the browser show its automatic install promotion:
- Most browsers will automatically show an install banner or button when the criteria are met
- For example, Chrome shows an install button in the address bar on desktop[1]

3. Create a custom in-app install promotion:
- Add your own install button or banner within your PWA's UI
- Trigger the install prompt programmatically when the user clicks your custom button[1]

4. Use strategic placement:
- Show the install promotion after the user has engaged with your site
- Place it outside of critical user flows
- Consider using a banner at the top of the page or in the navigation[1]

5. Provide context:
- Explain the benefits of installing the PWA
- Highlight that it uses minimal storage and installs instantly[1]

6. Allow dismissal:
- Let users dismiss or decline the install promotion
- Remember their preference and don't show it again immediately[1]

7. Test thoroughly:
- Use Chrome DevTools to debug issues with the install banner
- Test on real devices, as emulators can be unreliable for PWA install prompts[4]

8. Consider platform differences:
- iOS requires adding to home screen manually, so provide instructions
- Android allows automatic install banners in supported browsers[5]

The key is to meet the technical criteria, create a compelling install experience, and test thoroughly across devices and platforms. Avoid being overly aggressive with promotions, and focus on highlighting the benefits to users.
