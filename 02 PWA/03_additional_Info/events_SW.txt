Service workers have several key events that can be used to monitor their lifecycle and behavior:

1. Installation event:
The `install` event fires when a service worker is first registered and installed[1][4]. You can use this to set up initial caches:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  console.log('Service worker installing');
  // Perform install steps, like caching static assets
});
```

2. Activation event:
The `activate` event fires when a service worker becomes active and ready to control pages[1][4]:

```javascript 
self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
  console.log('Service worker activated');
  // Perform activation tasks, like clearing old caches
});
```

3. Fetch event:
This event fires whenever a network request is made within the service worker's scope[1][4]:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  // Intercept and handle network requests
});
```

4. Push event:
Triggered when the service worker receives a push notification[4]:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('push', (event) => {
  // Handle incoming push notifications
});
```

5. Sync event:
Fires when a background sync is triggered[4]:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  // Perform background sync operations
});
```

6. Message event:
Used for communication between the service worker and the main thread or other clients[2]:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  // Handle messages sent to the service worker
});
```

To monitor the overall lifecycle, you can use the `navigator.serviceWorker.register()` method, which returns a promise that resolves with a `ServiceWorkerRegistration` object[1]. This object provides properties like `installing`, `waiting`, and `active` that you can use to track the service worker's state.

For debugging purposes, Chrome DevTools provides a way to inspect service workers and view their logs[2]. You can access this by going to the Application tab in DevTools and looking under the Service Workers section.

It's important to note that service workers have a specific lifecycle. They can be in various states like installing, installed, activating, activated, and redundant[4][5]. Understanding these states and the events associated with them is crucial for effectively monitoring and managing service workers in your application.
