Based on the search results, it is generally recommended to use service workers in a React SPA (Single Page Application) to improve the performance and offline capabilities of the app. Here are the key points:

1. **Offline-first experience**: Service workers enable an offline-first approach, allowing your React app to work reliably even when the user has poor or no network connectivity. This is a key feature of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

2. **Faster load times**: Service workers can cache essential resources like JavaScript, CSS, and images, allowing the app to load much faster on subsequent visits, even when the user is offline.

3. **Create React App support**: Starting from version 4.0, Create React App (the popular tool for setting up React projects) comes with built-in support for service workers and the Workbox library, making it easier to integrate service workers into your React app.

4. **Customization**: The search results show that you can customize the service worker behavior, such as controlling the caching strategy, handling network requests, and managing updates, to fit the specific needs of your React application.

5. **Improved performance**: The search results mention that service workers can help boost the performance of a React app, especially for multi-page applications, by using techniques like navigation preload and streams.

However, there are a few caveats to consider:

1. **Development vs. production**: The search results suggest that service workers should only be enabled in the production environment, as they can cause issues during local development.

2. **HTTPS requirement**: Service workers require the app to be served over HTTPS, which can add some complexity to the deployment process.

3. **User awareness**: Users may not be familiar with offline-first web apps, so it's important to provide clear messaging about the app's offline capabilities and updates.

Overall, the search results indicate that using service workers in a React SPA is generally a good idea, as it can significantly improve the user experience, especially for offline and poor network conditions. The built-in support in Create React App makes it relatively straightforward to set up and customize service workers for your React application.
